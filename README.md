# Digital-Image-Processing-System-project-

A digital image processing system is a setup that involves hardware and software working together to perform operations on digital images. Its goal is to enhance image quality, extract useful information, or prepare images for further analysis and display.

ðŸ”§ Core Components
Image Acquisition: Captures raw image data using devices like cameras or scanners.

Preprocessing: Removes noise, adjusts contrast, or improves resolution to prepare the image.

Segmentation: Divides an image into meaningful regions for analysis, like identifying objects or boundaries.

Feature Extraction: Retrieves specific characteristics such as shape, texture, or color.

Classification: Uses algorithms to label image contentsâ€”commonly applied in facial recognition or medical diagnostics.

Post-Processing: Enhances the visual output or integrates the image into another system (like printing or display).
